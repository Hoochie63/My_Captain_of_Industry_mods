        Spec for a single I/O port on a machine layout. Consumed by `edit_machine_ports`
        and `clone_machine` to extend the connectivity surface of an existing or cloned
        building.

        Parameters:
            name:      single character port label. Used as the recipe-side port selector
                       (e.g. Product(..., port = 'w')). Must not collide with any port
                       already on the target machine's layout.
            type:      "input" or "output" (case-insensitive).
            shape:     IoPortShapeProto id string. Picks the physical transport shape the
                       port accepts. Common values from the base game:
                         "IoPortShape_Pipe"                 — fluid pipe
                         "IoPortShape_FlatConveyor"         — countable items on flat conveyor
                         "IoPortShape_LooseMaterialConveyor"— loose piles on covered conveyor
                         "IoPortShape_MoltenMetalChannel"   — molten metal channels
                       The shape's AllowedProductType must match recipes that route
                       products through this port.
            position:  relative tile coordinate on the layout where the port sits, as
                       (x, y, z) or (x, y) (z defaults to 0). Origin (0,0,0) is the
                       low-XY corner of the entity. The port itself "occupies" the edge
                       tile and points outward; the connected transport occupies the
                       neighboring tile in the `direction` of the port.
            direction: one of "+X", "-X", "+Y", "-Y" — direction the port faces, which is
                       also the direction the connected transport extends into.
            canOnlyConnectToTransports:
                       when True the port refuses direct machine-to-machine connections
                       and only accepts a transport (conveyor/pipe). Default False.

    add_texture_material but exposes the three texture channels the COI pile shader uses
    (`_AlbedoTex`, `_NormalsTex`, `_SmoothMetalTex`) as named parameters.

    Parameters:
        path:      asset path the new material will be registered under, e.g.
                   "Assets/MyMod/MyOreMaterial".
        albedo:    required. Single texture (mod-relative path or Tex) OR a list of textures.
                   For a single LooseProductProto, the first entry is what ends up rendered
                   (LPMM allocates one texture-array slice per product).
        normals:   optional. Same shape as `albedo`. If a single texture and `albedo` is a
                   list of N, replicated to N. If a list, count must match `albedo`. When
                   omitted, the cloned reference material's normals are kept ("copied from
                   reference").
        metallic:  optional. Same as normals — provides the smoothness (A) + metallic (R)
                   channel-packed texture for `_SmoothMetalTex`.
        reference: optional. Path to an existing pile material (vanilla COI or another
                   custom one) to clone shader + properties from. Defaults to
                   `Assets/Base/Products/Loose/FilterMedia_mat` so the new material always
                   carries the correct property layout — Mafi's pile shader is bundled,
                   not `Shader.Find`-able.
        tiling:    optional, default 1. Texture repetition factor when blitting into the
                   array slice. tiling=4 means the source is repeated 4×4 times within the
                   slice, so each rock/grain renders at 1/4 the size. Useful when the source
                   PNG has chunky high-frequency detail and you want it to look denser.
                   Source PNG must be tileable (seamless across edges) for clean results.

        color:          optional. Tint used in resource-overview UI (resourcesVizColor).
                        The actual pile appearance comes from `material`, not this color.
                        Defaults to white when omitted.
        particleColor:  optional. Color of conveyor-spill / mining particles for this
                        product. When omitted, the game auto-derives it from the average
                        of the pile albedo texture. Pass this to override that.
        isDumped:       dumped on terrain by default (vs. requires explicit player
                        marking). Effective only together with `dumpsAs`.
        isStorable:     can be stored.
        isRecyclable:   recyclable.
        isWaste:        marks as waste.
        isRough:        rough pile mesh (rocky/chunky); otherwise smooth (sand-like).
                        Also picks the default `prefabPath` if `prefabPath` is omitted.
        pinToHomeScreen: pinned to home-screen resource list by default.
        maxTransport:   max units per transported product (Quantity or int). Default 5.
        prefabPath:     override the pile prefab. Default picks rough/smooth pile based
                        on `isRough`.
        dumpsAs:        terrain-material id to transform into when dumped on the ground.

                        — the engine requires this mapping. Common picks:

                          Ids.TerrainMaterials.Dirt         — soil-like

    Register a prefab for a unit (countable) product. Produces a single-GameObject prefab

    `prefab` argument to build_product_unit().

    UNITS
    -----
    All distances in this method (width/height/depth, .obj vertex coordinates) are in
    METERS — the same convention Unity uses internally (1 Unity unit = 1 meter). One COI
    tile is 2 meters, so a 0.5m-wide item is a quarter of a tile across.

    For Auto packing to pick Triangle (3 items per tile), the mesh must satisfy
    sizeX < 0.5m AND sizeZ < 0.5m. Triangle layout spaces the three slots ~2*sizeX/sqrt(3)
    apart — for circular items (cylinders) this leaves a small visible gap; for items at
    the upper threshold (~0.5m) they will appear nearly touching, which is normal.

    Parameters:
        path:      asset path the prefab is registered under, e.g.
                   "Assets/MyMod/MyItem.prefab".
        albedo:    required. Single texture or list (only the first slice is used; list shape
                   matches add_loose_product_material for consistency).
        normals:   optional. Same shape rules as add_loose_product_material.
        metallic:  optional. Same shape rules as add_loose_product_material.
        reference: optional. Path to an existing material to clone. If omitted, the material
                   uses Unity's Standard shader — fine for most unit products since the unit-
                   product render path doesn't depend on a Mafi-specific shader.
        width, height, depth:
                   meters. Default 0.5 / 0.2 / 0.5. Used when `mesh` is not given. Origin
                   is at the bottom-center so the prefab sits on the conveyor naturally.
        mesh:      optional. Path to a Wavefront .obj file (mod-relative). When provided,
                   width/height/depth are ignored. Vertex coordinates in the .obj are also
                   meters. The .obj must be a single mesh; faces with >3 vertices are fan-
                   triangulated; UVs/normals are honoured if present (normals are
                   recalculated otherwise).
        winding:   "ccw" (default) or "cw". Controls how face corners are wound during

              - Auto               (default): picks Triangle/Row/Stacked from mesh size.
                                   For meshes with x<0.5 AND z<0.5 this becomes Triangle —
                                   three items per tile, the layout most modders want.
              - Triangle           : 3 per tile arranged in a triangle.
              - TriangleHorizontal : 3 per tile arranged horizontally.
              - Row                : items in a single row.
              - Stacked            : stacked vertically (for thin items).
              - StackedAlternating : stacked, every other item rotated.
            Case-insensitive strings also accepted ("Triangle", "row", etc.) for shorter call
            sites; the registrator parses them with Enum.Parse.
        allowPackingNoise:
            When True, each item gets a random yaw rotation noise applied for visual variety
            (so identical units don't all face the exact same direction on the conveyor).
        rotateSecondPackedItem90Degs:

    Register a RECIPE (inputs → outputs). As of the 0.3.0 game API, a recipe is a
    standalone object: it is NOT tied to a machine on its own. Machines are assigned
    separately with `bind_recipe(...)`, and unlocks with `add_unlock_recipe(...)`.
    A single recipe can be bound to several machines, each with its own duration and
    port mapping.

    Two ways to call it:

      1. Machine-less (recommended):
             r = build_recipe("Recipe_X", "X", "", ingredients=[...], products=[...])
             bind_recipe(r, "ChemicalPlant", duration=Duration.FromSec(30))

      2. Legacy one-shot (machine given): kept working for backward compatibility.
         When `machine` is supplied, the recipe is ALSO bound to that machine using
         `duration`, the per-`Product` `port` selectors, and — if `research` is set —
         a recipe unlock is wired. Equivalent to build_recipe(...) followed by a
         single bind_recipe(..., research=...). Unlike the old API, the recipe's
         `products` ports are NO LONGER validated against the machine at build time;
         port resolution happens per machine at bind time.

    Parameters:
        recipeId: required - recipe unique identifier
        name: required - display name
        description: optional - description
        machine: optional - LEGACY. When set, immediately bind the recipe to this
            machine (see above). Omit it and use `bind_recipe(...)` for the new flow.
        research: optional - only used when `machine` is set (legacy one-shot bind).
            Wires a recipe unlock on the given research node. Use `add_unlock_recipe`
            or `bind_recipe(..., research=...)` otherwise.
        duration: only used when `machine` is set. Default 60 seconds.
            May be redefined by Duration.FromSec(int) or by Duration.FromMin(int).
        ingredients: list - none, empty or at least one Product in case products are empty.
            Each Product's `port` becomes the input port selector for the legacy bind.
        products: list - none, empty or at least one Product in case ingredients are empty.
            Each Product's `port` becomes the output port selector for the legacy bind.
        power: optional - Percent value defining power consumption modification (lives
            on the recipe, applies to every machine it is bound to).

    Bind an existing RECIPE to a MACHINE (0.3.0 game API). This is the "assign a
    machine" half of the recipe split — `build_recipe(...)` makes the recipe, and one
    `bind_recipe(...)` call per machine attaches it with that machine's own duration
    and port mapping. Call it as many times as there are machines that should run the
    recipe.

    Two call forms:

      • Explicit:  bind_recipe(recipe, machine, duration=..., ports=[...])
      • In a `with build_recipe(...) as r:` block you may DROP the recipe and pass the
        machine first — the recipe comes from the enclosing context:
            with build_recipe("Recipe_X", "X", "") as r:

        In this context form the machine is the ONLY positional argument; pass
        everything else (duration, ports, …) by name.

    Parameters:
        recipe:   the RecipeProto (or id) from build_recipe(...). Omit it inside a
            `with build_recipe(...)` block (then `machine` becomes the first argument).
        machine:  machine the recipe is added to.
        duration: per-machine cycle time. Duration or int seconds. Default 60s.
            Different machines/tiers may run the same recipe at different durations.
        ports:    port mapping — a list of PortMap(product, port) entries. Each pins a
            product to a specific machine port letter. Products not listed auto-resolve
            to any free compatible port at bind time. (The visual editor always writes
            a complete map, one PortMap per product.)
        multiplier: integer throughput multiplier applied to all input/output
            quantities for THIS machine (default 1). Lets one base recipe be shared
            across machine tiers with different throughput.
        minPartialUtilization: optional Percent (or int percent). Partial-execution
            floor — the machine starts once it can run at least this fraction of a
            full cycle. None = always run a full cycle.

    Example:

    Register a new electricity generator that consumes a product and produces electricity.

    a SINGLE InputProduct -> Electricity (+ optional OutputProduct waste) mapping; the proto is

    fuel-relevant fields. The resulting machine looks like the source visually but consumes

                                  ElectricityGeneratorFromProductProto in the prototypes DB.
        duration:                 cycle time. Duration or int (seconds). Defaults to source's.
        generationPriority:       priority within the electricity grid. Defaults to source's.
        bufferCapacityMultiplier: internal buffer size factor. Defaults to source's.

    keep working because the original ports stay in place; new ports are simply added.

    Parameters:
        machine:    target building. Accepts MachineProto, MachineProto.ID, a string id,
                    or any LayoutEntityProto. Resolved through the prototypes DB.
        add_ports:  list of Port(...) specs. Each Port carries name, type, shape,
                    position, direction, and optional canOnlyConnectToTransports.

    Constraints:
        - Must be called during definition loading (before LockAndInitializeProtos). The
          Python load path always runs at the right time, so this is automatic — just
          don't try to invoke after game start.
        - Port names must not collide with existing port names on the target's layout.
          A collision raises ArgumentException at registration time.
        - The new port's `position` should sit on or just outside the building's tile
          footprint. The port label and arrow render in the empty tile adjacent to the
          port in the `direction` of the port. Off-footprint positions are allowed (the
          layout's tile coverage is left unchanged) but the in-game placement preview
          still has to find a connecting tile, so prefer positions on the building edge.

        reactor:    required. Id of the NuclearReactorProto to extend (vanilla or
                    modded). Common base-game ids: "NuclearReactor" / "NuclearReactorT2".
        add_ports:  list of Port(...) specs. Each Port carries name, type, shape,
                    position, direction, and optional canOnlyConnectToTransports.

    Constraints:
        - Must run during definition loading (the Python load path always does — just
          don't call after game start).
        - Port names must not collide with the reactor's existing fuel / water / steam
          / coolant ports. A collision raises ArgumentException at registration time.
        - Position should sit on or just outside the building's tile footprint, with
          `direction` pointing OUT of the building into the empty connecting tile.

    Example — add enrichment in/out ports to the vanilla reactor:
        edit_nuclear_reactor_ports(
            reactor   = "NuclearReactor",
            add_ports = [
                Port(name='e', type='input',  shape='IoPortShape_FlatConveyor',
                     position=(0, 2, 0), direction='-X'),
                Port(name='x', type='output', shape='IoPortShape_FlatConveyor',
                     position=(3, 2, 0), direction='+X'),
            ]
        )
    """
    pass

def edit_nuclear_reactor_fuels(
        reactor: str,
        add_fuels: list[FuelPair]
    ):
    """
    Append additional fuel cycles to an existing NuclearReactorProto WITHOUT cloning
    the whole reactor. Use when a mod just wants to drop a new fuel chemistry into a
    vanilla reactor (e.g. add CANDU rods to the base NuclearReactor) — much smaller
    surface than build_nuclear_reactor for that common case.

    Parameters:
        reactor:    required. Id of the reactor proto to extend (vanilla or modded).
                    Common base-game ids: "NuclearReactor" / "NuclearReactorT2".
        add_fuels:  required. List of FuelPair(fuelIn, spentFuelOut, durationSeconds)
                    entries to append to the reactor's fuel list.

    Caveat:
        The reactor's fuel-in / fuel-out port shapes are fixed at the source's first
        fuel pair's product types. Adding fuels of a DIFFERENT product type works
        in the fuel list but the physical port still only accepts the original
        type — the new fuel won't be insertable in-game. For different fuel types
        use build_nuclear_reactor with explicit fuelInPortShape / fuelOutPortShape.

    Example — add a CANDU rod to the vanilla reactor:
        edit_nuclear_reactor_fuels(
            reactor   = "NuclearReactor",
            add_fuels = [
                FuelPair(fuelIn="Product_Candu_rod", spentFuelOut="Product_SpentFuel", durationSeconds=120)
            ]

    Clone an existing NuclearReactorProto under a new id. Tunable: max power level,
    fuel capacity + minimum to operate, process duration, computing, AND the fuel
    cycle list (`fuel_pairs`). Structurally heavy fields that aren't yet exposed
    (coolant proto refs, port chars, enrichment data, water/steam product
    quantities, enrichment breeding ratios) still come from source — see the
    `EnrichmentData` notes in the C# proto for the full surface that could be
    added later.

    Parameters:
        fuel_pairs: optional list of FuelPair(fuelIn, spentFuelOut, durationSeconds).
                    When provided, REPLACES the source reactor's fuel list entirely;
                    a custom fuel chemistry (e.g. thorium → uranium-233) is added by
                    listing it here. When omitted (or empty), the source's fuel
                    pairs are inherited verbatim — including their breeding ratios.

        fuelInPortShape / fuelOutPortShape: optional IoPortShapeProto ids that
                    replace the source reactor's fuel-in / fuel-out port shapes
                    on the cloned layout. Use when the modder's fuel chemistry
                    is a different product TYPE than the source's (e.g. coal
                    is loose where uranium is unit) — the port has to physically
                    accept the new transport shape. Common values:
                      "IoPortShape_Pipe"                  — fluid
                      "IoPortShape_FlatConveyor"          — unit (countable)
                      "IoPortShape_LooseMaterialConveyor" — loose (pile)
                      "IoPortShape_MoltenMetalChannel"    — molten
                    When omitted, the runtime infers from the first fuel pair's
                    product type. Pass explicitly when the fuel-in and fuel-out
                    products differ in type (a mixed chemistry).
